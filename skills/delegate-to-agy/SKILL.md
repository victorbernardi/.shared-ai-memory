description: >-
  Delegate a coding task to the Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`) as a background implementer, then review
  its diff and land it yourself. Use this whenever the user wants to hand implementation work to
  Antigravity or agy - phrasings like "have Antigravity do X", "delegate this to agy", "run it through
  agy", or "use Antigravity to implement/fix/refactor" - or wants to run a queue of coding tasks
  through agy while staying the reviewer. Suitable for orchestrators like Codex, Command Code, and Claude Code.
  DO NOT USE for tasks small enough to do inline, or when the user wants the code written directly without delegating.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires the `agy` CLI installed and authenticated, Node.js (v18+), and git. The orchestrator must be able to run shell commands and read files. Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

# Antigravity Delegate (delegate-to-agy)

You are the **orchestrator** (e.g., Codex, Command Code, Claude Code). This skill lets you hand a bounded coding task to a separate **implementer** — the Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`) — then review what it produced and land it yourself. You write the brief and own the judgment; Antigravity does the typing in its own conversation; you verify and commit.

Nothing here is specific to one orchestrating agent. The loop needs only the ability to run a shell command and read a file, so any comparable agent can drive it.

## When NOT to use this

- The task is small enough to just do inline — delegation overhead is not worth it.
- The `agy` CLI is not installed or not authenticated. Install it from Antigravity's CLI docs and run the first-launch setup.
- You want to write the code yourself, or you only need Antigravity's opinion on code you wrote (a `--read-only` dispatch covers review without edits, but a plain review may not need delegation at all).
- You are already inside an Antigravity CLI session (AGY should not delegate to itself).

## Prerequisites (check once)

1. `agy help` succeeds. If not, install the Antigravity CLI and complete first-launch setup.
2. `agy models` succeeds. That proves the CLI can authenticate and list the available model labels.
3. Node.js is installed (`node -v`).
4. You are in (or will point `--cd` at) the target git repository.

In `--print` mode, Antigravity cannot prompt interactively for a write permission and may auto-deny it unless running with appropriate mode or flags. The relay detects that denial and reports failure in `result.json`.

## Choose the implementer model

`agy` has a configured default model, so `--model` is optional. Use it when the human has a preferred Antigravity model label for the task (e.g. `--model "gemini-3.7-flash-high"`). Otherwise let Antigravity use its own current default rather than guessing.

## The loop

Run these five steps per task. Steps 1, 4, and 5 are your judgment; 2 and 3 are mechanical.

### 1. Write the brief

Antigravity sees only the text you send plus what it can inspect in the workspace — no chat history, no shared context. Everything the task needs goes in the brief: the goal, the current state, what to change, what to leave untouched, the project's **actual** gate commands, and a report contract. Tell Antigravity it will **not** commit (you will). Keep one task per brief. Full guidance and a template: [references/writing-the-brief.md](references/writing-the-brief.md).

### 2. Dispatch

Send the brief to Antigravity with the bundled helper. It wraps `agy --print`, captures the run, and writes a structured `result.json` — so your only job is "run a command, read a file." (`<skill-dir>` below is this skill's installed directory — the folder containing this `SKILL.md`.)

```bash
node "<skill-dir>/scripts/relay.mjs" --brief brief.txt --cd /path/to/repo
# choose a model label:                 add --model "<label from agy models>"
# reasoning effort (low, medium, high): add --effort high
# read-only (plan mode — no edits):     add --read-only
# enable Antigravity terminal sandbox:  add --sandbox
# resume the most recent conversation:  add --resume-last  (delta brief only)
# continue specific conversation:       add --conversation <id>
# see all options:                      node .../relay.mjs --help
```

The helper starts a fresh Antigravity project by default and passes `--add-dir <repo>` (the `--cd` path, absolute) so `agy` has an explicit workspace. It does **not** pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions` by default. Mechanics, flags, and the `result.json` shape: [references/dispatch-and-poll.md](references/dispatch-and-poll.md).

### 3. Wait for completion

The helper blocks until Antigravity finishes:

- **Codex / Command Code:** run the command in your shell tool. For longer tasks, set an adequate timeout or background it and poll `result.json`.
- **Claude Code:** run the Bash call with `run_in_background: true`; you are notified on completion.

Do not trust progress trackers over reality: a run is finished when `result.json` is written and the process has exited. Read the working tree, not a status line. The implementer's full report is the `finalMessage` field in `result.json` (also printed in full on stdout between the report markers).

### 4. Review — do not trust the self-report

Antigravity's `result.json` includes its own final message and any gate claims. **Re-verify, don't accept:**

- **Re-run the project's gates yourself** (the test/lint/build commands from step 1).
- **Read the diff** against the brief: did Antigravity do what was asked, nothing more and nothing less? `touchedFiles` in the result is your starting point.
- **Run the relevant guard skills** on the diff if you have them installed.
- For schema/migration changes, round-trip them; for removals, grep for dangling references.

Full checklist: [references/review-and-land.md](references/review-and-land.md).

### 5. Land it

The implementer edits the working tree; **the orchestrator commits.** Only after the gates pass and the diff holds:

- Commit the verified work yourself, with a clear message.
- If it needs changes, send a delta brief with `--resume-last` (or `--conversation <id>`) and review again.

## Permission model

Antigravity owns its own permission policy. The relay does not bypass it by default. Use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` only when the human explicitly accepts that Antigravity may auto-approve tool permission requests. `--read-only` runs `agy` in plan mode (`--mode plan`), removing write and edit paths, and is mutually exclusive with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Use `--sandbox` when you want Antigravity's terminal sandbox enabled for the run.

If headless `--print` auto-denies a write, the relay reports `status: "failed"` and exits non-zero. The relay fingerprints the working tree before and after a `--read-only` run to report `readOnlyViolation` in `result.json`.

## Authorization model

Delegation is something the human opts into. Once they have ("run this queue", "proceed"), committing verified, gate-passing work is the agreed contract. Two limits on that mandate: **surface, don't absorb** (report Antigravity's design decisions, defensible-but-unasked turns, and non-blocking nitpicks rather than silently keeping them) and **stop for scope changes** (if correct completion needs going beyond the brief, ask — don't expand the mandate yourself). The full treatment is in [references/review-and-land.md](references/review-and-land.md).
