# Unattended automation

Use automation only in a clean linked Git worktree or an isolated non-Git scratch directory named `agy-scratch-*`. Keep commit, push, merge, deployment, and destructive cleanup outside this wrapper.

Create `<workspace>/.agy/task.json` with this schema:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "workspace_mode": "linked-worktree",
  "kind": "implement",
  "objective": "Implement the scoped change.",
  "acceptance_criteria": ["The focused tests pass."],
  "read_paths": ["AGENTS.md", "src", "test"],
  "write_paths": ["src/feature.js", "test/feature.test.js"],
  "out_of_scope": [".env", "secrets"],
  "timeout_seconds": 300,
  "conversation_id": null
}
```

All paths must be relative to the workspace. The wrapper rejects unknown fields, rooted paths, `..` escapes, `.agy` write targets, write/out-of-scope overlaps, missing read paths, missing write parents, main Git worktrees, dirty or populated ignored paths in linked worktrees (except the task file), allowlist paths that traverse reparse points, reparse points anywhere in scratch workspaces, and timeouts outside 30–900 seconds. It also fails if AGY modifies the task file or changes paths outside `write_paths`. The task is parsed from a bounded UTF-8 snapshot held under a read lease while the invocation runs; a changed task is rejected before cache or AGY execution.

Use `kind: "implement"` with a null conversation ID for the first run. Use `kind: "remediate"` with the successful implementation conversation UUID only when sending Codex review findings back to AGY.

After a successful run, the wrapper writes `<task-name>.result.json` beside the task file. The receipt binds the task SHA-256, successful conversation ID, and hashes of all allowed outputs. Re-running an unchanged task with unchanged outputs returns a cached `SUCCESS` without contacting AGY. Changing the task or any allowed output invalidates the receipt and causes a real run.

The wrapper always passes `--model gemini-3.7-flash-high` to AGY. This fixed model is independent of the model selected for Codex, is not configurable through the task file, and is exposed by `-ValidateOnly` and generated receipts/attempts. Process stdout and stderr are read concurrently in bounded 8 KiB blocks, retain at most 1 MiB per stream, and mark oversized output as invalid terminal evidence. After timeout or stream failure, the wrapper kills the process tree and fails closed unless every process captured before termination is confirmed stopped; stream draining is bounded to five seconds.

Every real AGY invocation that leaves the wrapper-controlled task and receipt
intact appends an `attempts` entry. Each entry records the implementation or
remediation kind, AGY terminal status, exit code, failure category when applicable,
completion time, and:

- `usage_cumulative`: AGY's conversation-cumulative input, output, thinking,
  cache-read, and total token counters;
- `usage_delta`: tokens attributable to this invocation, calculated from the prior
  attempt in the same conversation;
- cumulative and per-invocation deltas for `num_turns` and `duration_seconds`.

For a fresh implementation conversation, cumulative usage is also its invocation
delta. For remediation, AGY reports conversation-cumulative counters, so the
wrapper subtracts the prior recorded cumulative values. When an older receipt or
invalid terminal output lacks a required counter, the corresponding delta remains
`null`; it is never estimated. A cache hit and a rejection before AGY starts append
no attempt because no AGY invocation occurred.

If AGY tampers with the task or pre-existing receipt, the wrapper stops without
rewriting that evidence; the raw terminal output remains the only usage source for
that exceptional invocation.

Retain the successful receipt and task file through independent Codex review, the
immutable candidate, and the frozen candidate gate. Removing them immediately
after focused checks can prevent receipt-bound remediation for a later finding.
Keep both private and outside the accepted commit; remove them only at the declared
worktree cleanup point.

After a failed run without prior successful remediation evidence, the same receipt
path contains `status: "NEEDS_FOLLOWUP"`, a failure `category`, `retryable`, the
task hash, terminal status, process exit code, and allowed-output state. It omits
the raw conversation ID and error text. A failed receipt is diagnostic evidence,
never a cache hit or authorization for a dirty baseline, and a later successful
fresh run may replace it.

When a failed remediation follows a successful receipt, the wrapper preserves the
successful task/output binding and appends the failed attempt telemetry to it. It
also records `current_attempt_status: "NEEDS_FOLLOWUP"` and
`last_attempt_category` so the latest remediation outcome is visible. The
top-level `status: "SUCCESS"` continues to describe only the last successful
task/output binding; a failed invocation never becomes successful merely because
its usage was recorded.

Failure categories have fixed retry semantics:

- `transient_unavailable`: retryable once only when the workspace is unchanged;
- `permission_denied`, `canceled`, `timeout`, `invalid_terminal_output`,
  `process_error`, `terminal_error`, and `scope_drift`: do not retry the same
  task automatically.

The wrapper tells AGY not to invoke shell, Git, package-manager, test, or network
commands. Codex supplies explicit read paths, runs validation independently, and
must not convert a permission denial into unrestricted execution.

For `remediate`, the prior successful receipt may authorize existing changes only
inside `write_paths` when its conversation ID matches the remediation task and its
recorded output hashes still match the workspace. This is not a cache hit: the
wrapper contacts the same AGY conversation and replaces the receipt only after a
successful remediation. A stale receipt, conversation mismatch, output mismatch,
or dirty path outside `write_paths` still fails baseline validation.

Run the installed wrapper directly, resolving the Codex home directory on the current machine:

```powershell
$codexRoot = if ($env:CODEX_HOME) { $env:CODEX_HOME } else { Join-Path ([Environment]::GetFolderPath('UserProfile')) '.codex' }
& (Join-Path $codexRoot 'skills\delegate-to-agy\scripts\invoke-agy.ps1') -TaskFile C:\absolute\workspace\.agy\task.json
```

Use `-ValidateOnly` while preparing or testing a task. It validates the task and prints the resolved scope without contacting AGY or requiring the AGY executable to be available.

## Recommended phase order

Before the first invocation, use `-ValidateOnly` and confirm that `write_paths`
already contains every final destination required by the objective. A successful
receipt binds the original task and outputs; it cannot authorize a later directory
expansion or relocated module tree.

When dependencies permit, use this order:

1. validate the task and final path contract;
2. run the AGY implementation;
3. inspect the actual diff and run a cheap objective-specific semantic probe;
4. complete evidence-driven AGY remediation;
5. materialize large ignored dependency, build, or test trees;
6. run focused checks and the declared broad gate.

The semantic probe must distinguish completion from a syntactically valid no-op.
When the recorded baseline did not already satisfy the Definition of Done,
examples include a required non-empty diff, the presence of named output modules,
a reduced source-file size, stable selector order with resolved-value equivalence,
or another measurable invariant from the acceptance criteria.

Large ignored trees can make a later remediation fail baseline validation. Do not
delete or rebuild them merely to regain wrapper eligibility. If validation must
materialize them before remediation, declare that constraint and the bounded Codex
capability-handoff path before the initial invocation.

## Worker authorization visibility

When a coordinator-owned Codex subagent invokes the wrapper, the host approval
reviewer may require the user's external-delegation authorization to be directly
visible in that worker's trusted input. A coordinator message can carry scope but
may not satisfy that trust check. Create the worker after authorization or use a
supported context-inheritance mechanism. If a pre-process approval rejects a
worker created before authorization, do not keep retrying the same relay or move
execution into the coordinator. Create a replacement only after the user
explicitly authorizes the replacement topology and its directly inherited AGY
scope. A rejection before process creation is not an AGY invocation.

Before creating the worker, record a disclosure authorization packet containing:

- the trusted user turn or policy boundary;
- canonical private repository identity;
- exact read paths or content classes and write paths;
- explicit exclusions; and
- the selected inherited-context slice.

Verify that the slice actually contains the authorization-bearing user input.
The task file and coordinator packet constrain scope but do not independently
prove user authorization. If the host blocks disclosure before process creation,
record the pre-process decision, `invocations: 0`, and the Codex handoff; do not
create a receipt attempt or reuse the same relay as a retry.

Receipts bind the task and actual allowed outputs. They do not prove that an
output satisfies a semantic or cross-platform byte contract. For portable exact
text, define repository-owned EOL policy (for example `.gitattributes`) and verify
the immutable committed blob; use raw worktree bytes only when host-specific
materialization is intentionally part of acceptance.

## Runtime artifacts and capability handoff

Before delegation, declare ownership and lifecycle actions for environments,
dependency trees, caches, generated outputs, and test artifacts. Prefer invoking
AGY before creating large ignored runtime trees when practical. If runtime
artifacts are required, preflight the validation command and record whether Codex
may create, reuse, or remove them. Do not delete or rebuild an environment merely
to satisfy wrapper cleanliness. Use an exact cleanup envelope only when the user
authorized it and path and reparse-point checks pass.

If AGY cannot complete a structural operation with its permitted tools—for
example, deleting a tracked file—stop the AGY loop instead of producing empty
placeholders or repeating the same attempt. Return a capability handoff containing
the baseline, actual diff, completed criteria, remaining gap, unavailable
operation, validation evidence, receipt and private routing location, and one next
Codex action. The economic loop cap remains a ceiling; capability handoff can occur
at any earlier loop.

Record one handoff category: `runtime_materialized`, `runtime_only_finding`,
`unsupported_operation`, `external_disclosure_denied`, `new_authority_required`,
or another concise evidence-backed value. Keep validation-only runs, cache hits,
pre-process decisions, real AGY invocations, AGY remediation loops, and Codex
handoffs as separate counters.

The companion Codex rule allows only the installed wrapper executable path. Preview it with `scripts/install-rule.ps1`; install it only with `scripts/install-rule.ps1 -Apply`. Because subsequent arguments are allowed by a prefix rule, the wrapper must remain outside AGY's writable workspace and must continue rejecting unknown parameters and unsafe task content. After installing or changing a rule, restart Codex and verify it with `codex execpolicy check`.
